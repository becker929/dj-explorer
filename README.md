# dj-explorer

A web app for exploring DJ mixes from SoundCloud, made in Flask with Flask-SocketIO. The search is based on the text descriptions of mixes and it is capable of finding mixes when given a track as well as finding tracks when given a mix. No fancy audio-based search, for now.



## How to run



$ python3 main.py


This will run the Flask server, which can the be accessed via the browser at http://0.0.0.0:80/mix-explorer . 



I am running this on a Google Compute Engine Linux VM and serving it at http://anthonybecker.xyz/mix-explorer .
